First day
===

Setting up project and cross compiler. Make notes on how to setup your system for the project

Second day
===

Problems with creating cross compiler toolchain. Switch to docker instead which will emulate an arm system. Also this will be easier to use on other platforms as well

Day Three
===

Switch to archlinuxarm since they have a cross crompiler toolchain that works
